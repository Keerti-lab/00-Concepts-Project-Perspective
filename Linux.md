## Waterfall model

- Clients cannot see the application until it is released
- There used to be only one final release in the PROD stage to clients
- No testing until the whole product is developed
- This is the case until 2012

## Agile model

- Product is divided into multiple modules and are referred as **Sprint based development**
- Duration for each sprint is less for e.g. One month
- All teams that are involved in the project are part of this sprint planning meetings
- First 2 weeks is the development phase and next 2 weeks is for testing and deployment phase
- With this the client can test the application at their end at the end of each sprint
- Then DevOps came into picture which is again an Agile model but with a simple process change
- After developing each feature, it is tested by the testing team and deployed immediately
- Communication, Collaboration and Co-operation
